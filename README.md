# Very simple JavaScript smooth scroll
Using vanilla JS, this is a very simple JavaScript smooth scroll script with ease in and out.

## How to use?
1. Add `<script src="smoothscroll.js"></script>` inside the body tag.
2. Add a preferred `id="example"` to an element you'd like to scroll to.
3. Add `data-scrollto="example"` to an element you'd like to scroll from. For example, this could be `<a data-scrollto="example">Link</a>` but you can link from other elements like span, div, or img too.
4. Ta-da!
